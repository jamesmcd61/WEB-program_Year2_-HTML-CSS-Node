	Animal Rescue (The Emma Animal Rescue Society), its mission is to rescue, rehabilitate and re-home domestic animals, as well as provide veterinary services to local communities.
These animal that we care for have come from abused or neglecting homes or have been abandoned. These animals we know need love and care as well so we take it into our own hands to try find them new homes.
Our Visions are for people to see these abuse and abandoned animals and  to see what we see,that they need love and care and dont deserve to be abandoned and left out from a good loved life.We hope that
they will aswell adopt and care for one maybe.This is for the world which we see and that is the bond between human and animal  and there bond forever lasting.

	<!--second paragraph-->
	Tears,1999"The seeds that would eventually grow into TEARS Animal Rescue were planted when three women, Emma Geary-Cooke, Joan Bown and Marilyn Hoole , visited Masiphumelele with a bucket of tick dip and a packet of de-worming tables. It was the desperate state of the dogs and cats they found in this impoverished area that motivated the women to begin to dream of starting an organisation that would alleviate the suffering of the animals they were trying to help, but on a much larger and more effective scale.

	Tragically, Emma was killed in a car accident. Devastated but undaunted, Joan and Marilyn were determined to carry Emmas dream forward. In January 1999 The Emma Animal Rescue Society (TEARS) was established in her memory.

	At this time the plight of domestic animals in Masiphumelele had reached a crisis point. Mange was rife and many animals were skeletal , their guardians living in abject poverty, sometimes unable to feed themselves. De-worming, vaccinations and sterilisation were unheard of. Female dogs suffered from malnutrition and were unable to feed their puppies; many died.

	TEARS had started a clinic in Masiphumelele by March 1999, treating animals for fleas, mange and tick infestation. Food parcels were handed out. Animals needing veterinary attention and sterilisation were identified and arrangements made to have them treated by local vets.

	Founder, Marilyn, says, "We began to accumulate unwanted and stray animals and desperately needed facilities in which to house them. We began to rent kennels in Ottery for our rescued dogs. Cats, kittens and puppies were housed at the home of a TEARS committee member in Muizenberg, which also served as TEARS Headquarters."

	TEARS was later able to move to rented premises in Sunnydale and has grown into an established and sustainable non-profit organisation with a compliment of over 50 staff caring for around 300 dogs and cats on site at any given time.

	Wenga Farm, bought by the organisation in 2007, houses the TEARS Cattery, its boarding facility, the Feral Cat Project and a small clinic."
